These are just some ideas I’ve been thinking about for when (or if) I get my PhD and become a professor and maybe, hopefully even start my own university someday. I will call it **Kingsford University**. It's directly related to my first name **Kiarash**, which means "king arash" in Persian and Ferdousi's Shahnameh. **Kingsford** also means “the king’s ford” or “king’s crossing” in Old English. I’m not sure if I will ever get to that point, but it’s fun to think about :)
Take a look at `kingsford.pdf` :D
